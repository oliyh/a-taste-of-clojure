          <h2>How my journey began</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            I started my career as a Java developer by default - all the jobs going at the time were in Java and I'd picked up a bit at university although I had some self-taught knowledge of ASP, PHP, Javascript and the like.
            After moving through several teams, inheriting codebases of various ages and in various states I settled into a team that was "agile", did "TDD", "XP" and everything else where I learned vast amounts about proper software craftmanship and was very happy there for several years refactoring my way through tens of thousands of lines of carefully extracted interfaces, thoughtfully devised abstractions and meticulously complete stubs for mocked tests.
            We had some discussions about how Java's inheritance model didn't really let us express what we wanted to do, which at the time was something more akin to traits but I never seriously considered that rewriting the beast in a language with more features was possible.
            Fortunately a more enlightened team member introduced us to Clojure - this was around 2012 - and suddenly I had a totally different perspective on programming which I hope to share with you now.

          <h2>Clojure</h2><br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Functional</li>
            <li>Simple, concise</li>
            <li>Immutable data</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            These three points are the most important things to know about Clojure.
            Number one, it's functional, meaning functions are first class. You can declare and call functions, pass functions into other functions and return functions just as you would any other piece of data.
            Two is that it is simple and concise - there is very little syntax. Calling functions and data literals is pretty much all you need which makes it quick to learn and easy to read.
            Third is that data structures are immutable and highly efficient. This means that if I have a reference to some data I can guarantee that no one else can change it while I'm using it.
            I'll come back to these later to discuss in more detail.
            They are listed here because they're not the norm for programming languages, even though we could probably agree that they're good things.
            They are also basic, fundamental things. Clojure doesn't really have any clever, complicated high level abstractions that you have to learn. Abstractions are what the programs we write should do, and trying to line up the abstractions of our programs with the abstractions of our language is often quite hard to do and can add a lot of complexity.
            Clojure is about stripping out all the complexity that comes from the language and giving you a tool that does simple, fundamental things very well.

          <h2>Clojure ðŸ’– JVM</h2>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          (Clojure <span class="yellow">ðŸ’–</span> Javascript too)

          <aside class="notes">
            One thing missing from the previous slide is a practical and non-functional feature of Clojure which is that it compiles to and runs on the JVM. This was a pragmatic decision made both to improve Clojure's adoption appeal to people already familiar with the JVM and because of the high performance. In addition Clojure's ability to interop with Java code means that it benefits from all the libraries in the Java ecosystem so Clojure could hit the ground running without a lot of libraries having to be written first.

            Deployment is shipping an uberjar and running it with java -jar and popular deployment stacks like Heroku support Clojure making deployment really easy.

            Clojure also compiles to Javascript which is now the world's most widespread runtime, and takes it to places that we never dreamed of before. Clojure can be used in browsers and on servers which makes it amazing for full stack development.

            The simplicity of lisps has always been a great benefit for executing them on different runtimes. They tend to be bootstrapped from a few simple concepts which need implementing on the platform and you're away. There is a lisp called Shen which was designed for portability, and currently has implementations on 9 different runtimes.

          <img src="img/xkcd-lisp.jpg"/>

          <aside class="notes">
            There are now two build tools, after many years with just one, that take care of all your dependencies, versioning, run profiles and everything else. They're both implemented in Clojure so understanding them, extending and changing them is quite easy.

            You can write Clojure with great editor support in Intellij, emacs, Eclipse and vim.
            Some tools which really help are paredit for emacs which abstracts away all the parentheses into operations on s-expressions. I know they can be intimidating at first but after getting used to them and the naked structure of lisp unfolds before you, the patterns and metapatterns dance and you swim in the purity of quantified conception of ideas manifest.

          <aside class="notes">
            Functional languages treat functions as first class citizens that can be referred to in the same way as everything else, allowing them to be passed around, called, closed over. Of course, you can achieve similar-looking code in a non-functional language but at a far greater cost in boilerplate, lines of code and glue which all add to the cognitive weight of the project.

            When everything is stripped back to the bare definition of what it does it removes a lot of background processing from your brain, giving you a little extra capacity to focus on the task in hand. When entire concepts are removed, like static or final or overrides, you can look at a function and see what it does without worrying about constantly trying to work out if it was called on an instantiated object or is static, if the current state of the object can affect the return value, if this is the function being called or if someone has overridden it somewhere else.

            Your brain can slowly unwind and think about the problem you're actually trying to solve, to derive data from other data, and not have to fight uncertainty which has been built into the programming language you're using.

            Clojure owes its simplicity to its creator, Rich Hickey, who is a deep thinker and gave a great talk entitled Simple Made Easy explaining the rationale. Itâ€™s relatively new and designed by one person â€“ rather than being old, with a lot of legacy and backward compatability, designed by a committee.

          <aside class="notes">
            All of Clojure's data types are immutable. You can do anything with them, but you can't do anything to them. Every operation on them returns new immutable data and the original is unchanged. Here, the array of numbers is unchanged even when I call functions to double or square every element. This is because the arrays I get back are brand new immutable arrays containing new data, leaving the old one untouched.

            Seems like a simple concept, and it is. The same concepts exists in other languages too but is rarely the default and is something you have to go out of your way to use.

            Why is this such a big deal? Because, in normal code, it guarantees thread safety. The source of some of the most difficult to solve problems is suddenly eradicated completely. It's comparable to the way the JVM's memory model suddenly eradicated the whole concept of buffer overflow bugs, bugs which still afflict us today in the guises of Heartbleed and just a couple of weeks ago Cloudflare's Cloudbleed incident.

            A lot of clever work went into making the Clojure data structures perform well. There are shorcuts, like concatenating lists returning a sequence referring to the original lists without actually copying the data on the heap. There is also some wizardry going on - there was an excellent talk at EuroClojure 2015 by Mohit Thatte about the implementation and some of the original solutions which were devised to make it work.

          <aside class="notes">
            Immutability gives rise to the possibility of code that evaluates lazily, at another time and even in another thread, on basic data structures.

            This can also lead to inversion of control e.g. describe an infinite sequence and decide outside the sequence how many elements you want, rather than having to pass in an arbitrary limit to the sequence which pollutes your pure mathematical definition.

          <aside class="notes">
            Having said all that, Clojure is a pragmatic and usable language, and sometimes you need a little bit of state to be able to achieve that. Clojure's answer is to construct a small walled garden around special mutable references to immutable data, which are called atoms. The value an atom refers to can be updated atomically, and the values themselves are immutable.

            This gives us a safe place to store stateful things and reminds us that we are using state by making us use the wrapper functions around it. Outside the transaction we have normal Clojure data and can use it in the same way as any other data with perfect thread safety.

          <h2>REPL</h2><br/>

          Video of stuff happening in a repl here, in case it all goes wrong, but
          consider live coding as well

          <aside class="notes">
            The REPL is a live coding environment where you can evaluate any expression. REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop and is not unique to Clojure but to Lisps in general and even a command line interface can be thought of in the same way.

            It allows you to jump straight into using Clojure without having to understand how an entire program fits together or anything else, so it's great to get started with but there is a much greater impact of having this tool at your disposal.

            The IDEs I mentioned earlier integrate with a REPL environment and allow you to live-evaluation code in your IDE. You can hotload changes in source code into the REPL and it becomes a live playground for building, trying and testing code. There's a feeling that you no longer hold your code at arm's length, interacting with it only through tests. It's more like you can now hold it in your hand, turn it to see it from different angles, try things with it and play with it.

            It encourages exploration and less reliance on the test scaffolding we might otherwise normally write as part of dogmatic TDD.

          <aside class="notes">
            The question I'd expect to be asked by a lot of developers coming from languages with type systems would be how we survive without one.

            In type systems like Java's, all the type system really tells you is that your function takes one particular kind of data and returns another kind. It doesn't help you avoid nulls, it doesn't help you cover all code execution paths, it doesn't let you skip writing code because the compiler can infer the code from your types. Languages like Haskell and Idris do those things, and are a completely different use case, but when it comes to types in Java we're really just talking about kinds of data.

            Clojure is good at data - it's designed for data. The data representations are succint and literal. Here is a vector, here is a map. Instead of checking just the kind of data, we can check the actual data flowing through our system.

            Clojure has a couple of libraries which let us describe the data we want and functions to coerce, conform and validate incoming data into the correct shape. We tend to put these checks at the edges of our systems so that we can reject data which is malformed and know with absolute certainty what the incoming data looks like. Our code within then becomes happy code without the need for null checks or guards for consistency.

            Having a description of data lets us generate data that looks like what we expect in the real world and opens up a whole new kind of testing.

          <h2>Always test the right thing</h2><br/>
          <img class="stretch" src="img/testing.gif"/>
          <aside class="notes">
            Testing in Clojure is the same as testing in any other language. The mindset of the tester though is different, because of the relationship we have with data.

            A typical unit test will consist of the normal, happy path, maybe a few edge cases and maybe a few error handling cases. These are chosen by the developer based on what they know of the problem space and coverage of the unit will usually be limited by time and imagination. My experience of Java was that the effort of constructing the right objects to give to the method being tested was equal or greater than either the production code or the assertions, and a weariness of so much code could also be a limiting factor.

            In Clojure function signatures tend to be smaller, because it is easier to get sub data out of our data to send in rather than sending the whole structure. Data literals make the tests much more readable because nothing gets in the way. Both these things help the time and weariness factors, but what about imagination? What is the right thing to test?

            As I just mentioned, we use descriptions of our data in our production code to validate it looks like what our code expects and reject data that doesn't fit. We can use these same descriptions in our tests to generate ALL the data and send it into our function. We're no longer limited by our imagination and we no longer need to worry if we've tested the right thing or the wrong thing, because we've tested all the things.

          <h2>Not so good</h2><br/>

          <aside class="notes">
            Of course there's no such thing as a silver bullet and I have to be honest about some of the shortcomings of Clojure.

            Startup speed - because after the runtime has started it still has to bootstrap itself before you can do anything. A lot better on Javascript though

            Refactoring - really quite good in intellij but still could be better.

            Profiling and debugging - a bit harder due to lazy evaluation and a lot of anonymous frames

            None of these are killers, just on the wishlist

          <h2>What does it mean?</h2><br/>
          <aside class="notes">
            I've spoken about a lot of details about Clojure. Some of them will be novel, some won't. You might think that you could accomplish the same things in language X, or Y, and you'd be right. Any language which is Turing complete can solve the same problems, but that doesn't make them all the same.

            Here are some things I've learned to really value about Clojure:
            - It's simple. I have functions and I have data, and when I call a function with some data I know, without having to think, exactly which function I called and I know it will return the same result every time I call it. It's something that you first accept, then take for granted and finally demand as a basic human right.

            - Data is everything. I want to see it and understand it, I don't want it hidden away in objects that obscure it and make me work to get the data back out. If you want the benefits of encapsulation to avoid an implementation detail being depended on in multiple places you can still write a function to achieve that - it's normal code reuse and we do it everywhere else.

            - Entire classes of bugs eradicated. My poor brain can focus on solving business problems rather than problems with my code! We've learned from and built upon our successes and failures of the past and today our options are better than ever.

            - Being able to write code that can be run identically on the JVM or in a browser is amazing. It can reach every device on the planet and it gives great confidence when approaching a new project that Clojure can adapt to work for it. I can confidently call myself a full stack developer without a nasty feeling that I'm really just keeping my head above water on the client side stuff.

          <h2>Community</h2><br/>

          <aside class="notes">
            Clojure's community is exciting because the language itself is still relatively new. It means that participants by definition are curious about new languages and bring their enthusiasm and thirst for learning with them. For the same reason it also means that developers come from many different backgrounds - some from Java and other JVM languages, some from other lisps, some from other functional languages. Everyone brings some knowledge with them and can feed the best bits into the ecosystem for us all to benefit from.

            Clojure itself is open source and has a public issue tracker that anyone can access. The creator of Clojure, Rich Hickey, along with the creator of Clojurescript David Nolen and many other contributors are found at the major conferences and are very well connected with those using the language.

            Clojure also seems to have attained a critical mass in industry adoption. Years back it would take a coordinated campaign of lobbying to have any new language considered over the Java and Dot Net status quo, including Clojure. The fact that it ran on an existing runtime was possibly what helped to tip the balance for our first few projects.

            Since then the increase in the number of usable, mainstream languages has helped make the argument easier but Clojure now has many high profile success stories. I've personally used it on successful projects in two investment banks and for the entire technology stack of one of the UK's largest property websites, OnTheMarket.com serving millions of users a day. The consultancy I work for, Juxt, specialises in Clojure and has helped deliver successful projects across many other industries from fashion to a boris bike scheme in Spain where Clojure runs on Point of Sale terminals. There are several teams with Clojure projects at Credit Suisse, where I am now, including the two owned by my team which are Clojure on the server and Clojurescript on the client. My team is also currently hiring so have a chat with me later if you'd like to know more.
