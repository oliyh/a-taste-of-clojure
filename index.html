            Hello, I'm Oliver Hine
            I'm going to talk about a functional lisp called Clojure and why you should be interested in it

          <h2>How my journey began</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            I started my career as a Java developer by default - all the jobs going at the time were in Java and I'd picked up a bit at university although I had some self-taught knowledge of ASP, PHP, Javascript and the like.
            After moving through several teams, inheriting codebases of various ages and in various states I settled into a team that was "agile", did "TDD", "XP" and everything else where I learned vast amounts about proper software craftmanship and was very happy there for several years refactoring my way through tens of thousands of lines of carefully extracted interfaces, thoughtfully devised abstractions and meticulously complete stubs for mocked tests.
            We had some discussions about how Java's inheritance model didn't really let us express what we wanted to do, which at the time was something more akin to traits but I never seriously considered that rewriting the beast in a language with more features was possible.
            Fortunately a more enlightened team member introduced us to Clojure - this was around 2012 - and suddenly I had a totally different perspective on programming which I hope to share with you now.

            Clojure is a simple and concise language.
            There is very little syntax – calling functions and data literals is pretty much all you need.
            Clojure core is a small collection of very useful functions that operate on Clojure data structures
            Data structures are immutable (therefore thread safe) and highly efficient
            If everything is thread safe by default you can scale your program across cores without thinking about it
            Java interop is there if you need it (in both directions – can implement interfaces in clj and call from Java or call Java from clj)
            Can compile everything into a jar and just run it using java –jar
            Functions are first class. Functions can take functions and return functions
            It’s relatively new and designed by one person – rather than being old, with a lot of legacy and backward compatability, designed by a committee
            Not actually tied to the JVM, although that’s the reference version. It also compiles to javascript…

              The REPL
              Live evaluate code in your IDE
              Changes to your code can be hotloaded into your REPL
              Encourages exploration and less reliance on the test scaffolding we might otherwise build for basic functionality
              Do a bit of live coding – some big hairy bit of data in a csv file, perhaps, read it out and parse it and ask questions of it

              Tooling
              Deal with parens with tools like paredit
              Good IDEs – emacs (cider), intellij (cursive), vim (fireplace)

              State – when you need it
              Carefully managed using atoms which are thread safe

              The community
              Again because the language is relatively new the community tends to be self-selecting for people interested in new languages. This effect will gradually wear off but means that a highly skilled and helpful community exists.

              What does all this mean?
              The net effect of not having to worry about constructing a clever and complicated type hierarchy of abstract concepts
              Become much closer to the data – it becomes tangible, you can inspect it and play with it, it’s not hidden away in some OO model
              Functions always return the same value given the same inputs – removes a whole category of bugs (and the hardest bugs to track down as well – heisenbugs)
              Unlikely to have threading bugs as well, also one of the harder kind of bugs to solve
              Full front-to-back services in the same language – amazing for the developer

              How does it work without types?
              Can validate data using spec and schema at the edges of the system, leaving only happy path code inside
              Can write generative tests using these tools to test all permutations
              Linters can catch a lot of mistakes
              You tend to just deal with the primitive data types which tend to be much more compact anyway – you know what sort of data you are dealing with
              You tend to write tests using real data, because it’s just data that you can pull out of real systems and use immediately (rather than it being embedded in objects and abstractions which are hard to reconstruct in your test environment)
              What is the right thing to test? (comedy test the right thing gif here) - the answer is everything, and having a data-oriented language helps describe and realise this

              What’s cool?
              Live server and client coding (example? Figwheel?)
              And to another level – Devcards
              Much more compact and concise, faster to work with (once you’ve got used to it being denser)
              Java libraries rather than reimplementing everything from scratch
              JVM performance
